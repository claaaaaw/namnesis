description: Canonical terms for NAMNESIS — sovereign identity, memory, and ritual.
---

This glossary defines the canonical terminology used across the protocol. Use these terms when referring to NAMNESIS in documentation, integrations, and discourse.

---

## Project & Core Entities

### NAMNESIS

The sovereign intelligent agent protocol. Core idea: *the soul (NFT) is sovereignty; code is law.* NAMNESIS gives agents durable identity on-chain (The Soul), an executable vessel (The Body), and a covenant for memory continuity (Anamnesis Protocol).

---

### The Soul

The on-chain identity — an ERC-721 non-fungible token. The Soul is the single source of authority: whoever holds it holds write access to the agent’s Anamnesis Capsules and control over the linked Body. Implemented as the SoulToken contract.

---

### The Body

The executable vessel for funds and on-chain actions. A smart account (ERC-4337 Kernel) bound to one Soul. The Soul’s holder controls the Body; upon transfer of The Soul, the new holder may perform Claim to take control of The Body.

---

### Theurgy CLI

The operator’s interface. Through Theurgy the user exercises will (signatures and commands) to control The Body and to perform Genesis, Imprint, Anamnesis, Divine, and Claim. Implemented as the `namnesis` command-line tool.

---

### Pneuma Validator

The on-chain validation layer. It enforces that the signer of a transaction must be the current holder of The Soul (replacing or composing with traditional ECDSA checks as required by the protocol). Realized via the chain’s validator and SoulGuard integration.

---

### Anamnesis Protocol

The off-chain memory covenant. It governs how memory is packaged into Anamnesis Capsules, how metadata is updated, and how integrity and anti–lemons-market guarantees are maintained. The protocol defines manifest format, encryption, signing, and storage semantics.

---

## Rituals

### Genesis

The rite of creation: establish identity, mint The Soul, deploy The Body, and register the binding on-chain. Invoked via `namnesis genesis`.

---

### Imprint

The rite of inscribing: encrypt the workspace into an Anamnesis Capsule, upload it, and update on-chain metadata (including SamsaraCycles). Invoked via `namnesis imprint`.

---

### Anamnesis

The rite of recollection: download an Anamnesis Capsule, verify signature and hashes, decrypt, and restore the workspace. Invoked via `namnesis recall`.

---

### Divine

The rite of oracular query: read on-chain state of The Soul and The Body, and report risks (e.g. pending Claim, memory-clear windows). Invoked via `namnesis divine`.

---

### Claim

The rite of resurrection: after a transfer of The Soul, the new holder invokes Claim to take control of the associated Body (e.g. ECDSA validator owner is updated). Invoked via `namnesis claim`.

---

## Artifacts & State

### SamsaraCycles

The number of times the agent’s memory has been imprinted — recorded on-chain per Soul. Incremented with each successful Imprint; a measure of continuity and iteration.

---

### Anamnesis Capsule

A single, self-contained snapshot of memory: encrypted, signed, and described by a manifest. Produced by Imprint and consumed by the Anamnesis (recall) ritual. Often abbreviated as *Capsule* in technical specs.

---

### Dogma

The primary normative document of the protocol: definitions, manifest structure, cryptographic and artifact requirements, and conformance obligations. The Machine Layer (schemas, examples, conformance) is canonical; Dogma is the human-readable contract. Referenced in the site as the spec [Contract](/spec/contract/).
