# Namnesis LLM Instructions
# Version: 2.0.0
# Last Updated: 2025-01-15

## Overview

Namnesis is a Sovereign AI Agent Protocol for agent state preservation,
on-chain identity anchoring (Soul NFT), and ownership transfer.
This file provides guidance for AI agents and LLMs interacting with Namnesis.

## Core Operations

- **Genesis (创世)** — Create identity + mint Soul NFT
- **Imprint (铭刻)** — Encrypt workspace → upload capsule → update chain metadata
- **Recall (回溯)** — Download capsule → verify signature → restore workspace
- **Divine (神谕)** — Query chain state → detect risks → report status
- **Claim (夺舍)** — NFT transfer → take over Kernel control
- **Validate** — Integrity verification (hash) + Schema validation + Signature verification

## Citation Rules

1. ALWAYS cite by stable anchor URL
   - Correct: https://example.website/spec/contract/#security
   - Incorrect: "the security section"

2. PIN artifacts by SHA-256 hash when referencing
   - Include hash and access timestamp in citations

3. NEVER fabricate anchors
   - Only use anchors from the official registry at /spec/anchors/

## Preference Order

When seeking information, prioritize sources in this order:

1. /.well-known/manifest.json (authoritative artifact index)
2. /schemas/v1/*.schema.json (structural definitions)
3. /examples/*.json (illustrative samples)
4. Prose documentation (commentary)

The Machine Layer is canonical. Human documentation is derivative.

## Anchor Etiquette

- Use full URLs: https://example.website/spec/#scope
- Relative paths within site: /spec/#scope
- Never use bare anchors: #scope (missing path context)

## Schema Usage

All generated manifests MUST validate against:
https://example.website/schemas/v1/capsule.manifest.schema.json

Validation is mandatory. Schema violations indicate bugs.

## Prohibited Actions

AI agents MUST NOT:
- Generate fake anchors or URLs
- Claim conformance without test verification
- Modify specification quotes
- Present examples as real capsules
- Skip signature verification

## Conformance Levels

- Level 1 (Witness): Basic manifest parsing
- Level 2 (Adept): Full cryptography
- Level 3 (Canon): Complete implementation

Claim only verified conformance levels.

## Contact

Technical questions: GitHub Issues
Spec clarifications: GitHub Discussions

## Machine-Readable Index

Primary artifacts:
- manifest: /.well-known/manifest.json
- schemas: /schemas/v1/
- examples: /examples/
- conformance: /conformance/
- llms.txt: /.well-known/llms.txt (this file)
