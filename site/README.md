# Namnesis Site (Design Pack)

This folder contains the **website design research** for Namnesis.

**Purpose:** a pure **showcase / introduction** site (no business logic, no login, no app). It exists to present the doctrine, the spec, and **one-line invocation**.

**Positioning:**
- **AI-first is real**: Machine Layer contracts are canonical.
- **Human browsing is intentionally uncomfortable**: cold, spec-like, "AI-only" console aesthetics as a marketing strategy.
- Copy and naming must feel **religious + philosophical** (rite, covenant, vows, sanctum, sigils). Avoid "backup/storage" framing.
- Core identity actions: **Genesis (创世) / Imprint (铭刻) / Recall (回溯) / Divine (神谕) / Claim (夺舍)**

## What's inside
- `IA.md` — sitemap + stable anchors (URLs + IDs)
- `UI.md` — UI moodboard (typography/layout/components/microinteractions)
- `COPY.md` — example hero + sample sections (tone guide)
- `MACHINE_LAYER.md` — required public artifacts + how the "Machine Layer panel" must work
- `STACK.md` — recommended static stack + file tree
- `ENGINEERING.md` — engineering implementation design
- `PHILOSOPHY.md` — philosophical meditations on agent identity

## Non‑negotiables
1) **Stable anchors** are part of the product (publish an anchor registry).
2) **Machine Layer panel** is always visible on the homepage and treated as primary interface.
3) Copy must emphasize **contract / conformance / covenant / continuity** (not "backup").
4) The site is static: **display + intro + one command**.
5) Terminology follows the **Namnesis lexicon**: Genesis, Imprint, Recall, Divine, Claim, Soul NFT, Capsule.
